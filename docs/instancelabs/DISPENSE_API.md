# Instance Labs dispense engine — Java API (`org.openpnp.instancelabs.dispense`)

Branch `il/bench-sync` (engine commit `271d4738f`: the bench recipe of 2026-10-28, `runs/p18_board1`: 160/160 pads,
0.714 mm², CV 13 %, 5,490 DPH). Spec: `docs/plan-2026-10-27-evidence-backed-roadmap.md` §4.4–4.6, §5.1–5.7, §6.1 (in
the openpnp-revamp project), changed by the bench recipe where this file says so. This file is the contract for the
web API layer (`docs/instancelabs/WEB_API.md`). Every machine action runs on OpenPnP's machine thread and returns a
`java.util.concurrent.Future`; only one dispense task runs at a time (`IllegalStateException("a dispense task is
already running")` otherwise).

Updated on `il/bench-sync-autoreg` (b81d73d21, 2026-10-29) for Register board, the N1 vacuum probe, home at job start
and the Z check (`AUTO_REGISTER_DESIGN.md`, marked *autoreg*), the board frame and drawing in plans
(`BOARD_IMPORT_DESIGN.md` plumbing, *board import*), and per-pad-type doses and the pad calibration
(`PROFILE_CALIBRATION_DESIGN.md`, "PC", marked *profile*: the pure model `org.openpnp.instancelabs.padprofile`, the dose
stream, `runDoseBlocks`, dose records and `applyPadCalibration`; the job that drives them is in the API layer,
`WEB_API.md` §3.5). Written from the code on `il/pc-integration`; where it differs from PC §5–§7 this file follows the
code. The test-board ladder (PC §20 decision 8, slice `pc-ladder`) is not in this PR: a follow-up. Updated on `il/rc1`
for the final fix round (E1 engine safety, E2 engine correctness): the pressure hold looked at again on the machine
thread by every task, a home that a STOP or a failure ends, the Z-check remedy under the same home, the blank's old
points kept as a Z reference, the probe window against the board top, the stream's pad index, whole-pad test runs,
the dose rule, the fiducial search and fit, and mass per dot laid.

## 1. Lifecycle

| Signature | Notes |
|---|---|
| `public static void DispenseService.install(Configuration configuration)` | Called from `org.openpnp.Main` right after `Configuration.initialize()`. Registers a `ConfigurationListener`; the service starts on `configurationComplete`. Never throws. |
| `public static synchronized DispenseService DispenseService.start(Configuration configuration) throws SQLException, IOException` | (Re)starts the service. Used by `install` and tests. |
| `public static DispenseService DispenseService.get()` | `null` before the configuration has loaded. |
| `public synchronized void shutdown()` | Aborts any run, removes the machine listener, closes the DB. |
| `public boolean isAvailable()` / `public String getUnavailableReason()` | Null-safe: if the dispenser nozzle (config `nozzle`, default `N2`, matched by id then name) does not exist, the service exists but every run method throws `IllegalStateException`. |
| `public Nozzle getDispenserNozzle()` | May be null. |
| `public Long getControllerConnectedAtMs()` | When OpenPnP last enabled (connected to) the controller; set by the machine listener. The B step count restarts at controller power-up, so the screw start angle is only valid after this time (I11). |
| `public HomeTracker getHomeTracker()` · `public HomeTracker.Plan homePlan()` | *autoreg.* Whether a task must home first under `homeBeforeRun` and why (`whyCode` `always`, `home-unconfirmed`, `stopped`, `not-homed`, `homed`), the last home, and the estimate (the last home the engine timed, in memory; 25 s before). Every engine or API home ends with `HomeTracker.homeEnded()`, also one a STOP or a failure ended: no start time stays behind, so the next clean home (OpenPnP's own Home button) is `homed`, not `home-unconfirmed`. |
| `public boolean isSimulatorConfirmed()` | *autoreg.* The controller answered as OpenPnP's simulator (`SimGuard`, or this service's `M115` at connect). Simulated registrations and surfaces are refused on a machine that is not. |
| `public boolean hasTopCamera()` · `public Nozzle getProbeNozzle()` · `public double[] probeNozzleZ()` | *autoreg.* The top camera Register board needs; N1 (`PROBE_NOZZLE`); N1's raw Z and whether a STOP left it below the safe zone (`{z, low}`). |

## 2. Configuration (`<configDir>/instancelabs/dispense-config.json`, never machine.xml)

| Signature | Notes |
|---|---|
| `public DispenseConfig getConfig()` | A copy (Gson-serialisable POJO, public fields). |
| `public synchronized void updateConfig(DispenseConfig newCfg) throws IOException` | Validates (`DispenseConfig.validate()`, which includes `profile.validate(cfg)`), writes atomically, applies. `IllegalArgumentException` on invalid input. A changed `profile.startAngleDeg` stamps `profile.startAngleSetAtMs`; a changed `needleXyTrim` stamps `needleXyTrim.setAtMs`. |
| `public synchronized DispenseProfile setStartAngle(Double angleDeg, String note) throws IOException` | I11: sets (`angleDeg` != null) or confirms (null) the screw start angle for the current controller power-up; stamps `startAngleSetAtMs`, logs an `I11` event. |
| `public synchronized void resetPurgeRow() throws IOException` | The purge row was wiped: `usedSpots = 0`, `resetAtMs = now` (I9). |
| `public synchronized void setLocation(String name, double x, double y, double z) throws IOException` | Named places (`waste`, `blank`, calibration cup, …): x/y in N2 machine coordinates, `z` = surface Z in OpenPnP's frame (the N1 nozzle Z touching that surface). |
| `public synchronized void markNeedleChanged() throws IOException` | I4: invalidates the needle Z frame and the offset until a new frame and a touch-off. |
| `public synchronized NeedleAnchor setNeedleAnchor(double surfaceZMm, double needleContactZMm, Double x, Double y[, Double rawSumMm])` | I4 needle Z frame: the same surface touched by N1 (`surfaceZMm`) and by the needle tip (`needleContactZMm`, N2 Z); offset := difference. `rawSumMm` records the bench relation K the contact came from (or null). Not a touch-off. |
| `public double needleContactZFromRawSum(double n1ContactZ, double rawSumMm) throws Exception` | Needle contact (N2 Z, OpenPnP frame) from the bench relation "needle contact raw Z = K − N1 contact Z" (side camera, 2026-10-27: K = 65.59). On the Lumen see-saw (z2 = 63 − raw) that is N1 − 2.59: N1 5.5 → needle 2.91, offset −2.59. |
| `public synchronized void setNeedleZOffset(double offsetMm, String method, String details) throws IOException, SQLException` | Manual offset entry or touch-off result; appends a `needle_touchoff` row. Must stay within `needleOffsetMaxDriftMm` of the frame's offset (I4). |
| `public synchronized SurfacePlane setSurface(String name, List<SurfacePoint> points, String note[, String boardFingerprint[, Boolean simulated]])` / `clearSurface(name)` / `surfacePlane(name)` | Probed surfaces (N1 contact heights, >= 3 points spanning an area; least-squares plane + convex hull). `board`: per-dot Z of board runs; `boardFingerprint` ties it to the board registration it was probed on (I4 asks for new probes after a re-seat). `blank`: the purge row, dot ladder and touch-off. |
| `public static String boardFingerprint(BoardLocation bl)` | Global location (incl. Z), side, fiducial transform and every placement, hashed: plan staleness at Run. |
| `public static String boardRegistration(BoardLocation bl)` | Board X/Y/rotation, side and fiducial transform only, hashed (`plan.boardRegistration`). A board surface is tied to it: I4 refuses an untied board surface and one probed on another registration (re-seat); editing placements or the nominal board Z does not change it. |
| `public boolean isBZeroed()` | I2 state: `G92 B0` sent since the last home / enable / disable. |
| `public synchronized Long setNewSeat(boolean newSeat)` | *autoreg.* The new-seat flag (`newSeatAtMs`, null when cleared): the next registration is a new seat. Register board clears it when it saves a probed surface. |
| `public static String boardZProblem(DispenseConfig c, double boardZ)` | *autoreg.* Why a board top Z cannot be an N1 contact height (more than `MAX_BOARD_Z_FROM_ANCHOR_MM` 2.0 from the needle-frame surface), or null. `planBoard` refuses with it. |

### `DispenseConfig` (schema 3)

`schemaVersion 3`. Schema 1/2 files load: removed keys are ignored, and `migrate()` brings the motion values to the
bench recipe (`travelAccelMmS2` and `zLiftAccelMmS2` 2000, `zLiftFeedMmS` >= 50, `bMaxFeedDegS` >= 2400,
`surfaceMaxResidualMm` <= 0.04, `surfaceMarginMm` >= 3.5, `zFrameToleranceMm` <= 1.2, `primeRotationDeg` 360 → 360.36).
Values a schema-2 file sets explicitly and `migrate()` does not touch (for example `valveSettleMs 1500` in
`/home/lumen/instancelabs/config/dispense-config.json`) stay as they are.

Removed in schema 3: `needleGapMm` (now `profile.gapMm`, read through `cfg.gapMm()`), `bFeedDegS`, `bAccelDegS2`,
`retractDeg`, `retractFeedDegS`, `dwellMs`, `abortDisablesB`, `primeAndTestDot`, `testDotOpticalCheck`,
`rePrimeRotationDeg`, `testDotMinDiameterRatio`, `provisionalQMm3PerRev`, `maxDotsPerPad`, `dotFitFactor`.

Fields and defaults:
- identity: `nozzle "N2"`, `bAxisName "b"`;
- pneumatics: `pumpToValveSettleMs 1000`, `valveSettleMs 3000` (bench `disp.py`);
- recipe: `profile` (below), `purgeRow` (below), `cleanPadCheck` (below);
- places: `locations {}`, `wasteLocationName "waste"`, `blankLocationName "blank"`;
- Z: `hopHeightMm 1.0` (0 < hop <= 10), `travelSafeZMm 31.5` (must map into the Z axis safe zone),
  `needleZOffsetMm 0`, `needleZOffsetSetAtMs null`, `needleChangedAtMs null`, `needleAnchor null`
  (`surfaceZMm`, `needleContactZMm`, `xMm`, `yMm`, `setAtMs`, `rawSumMm`), `surfaces {}` (`points`, `setAtMs`, `note`,
  `boardFingerprint` = the board registration it was probed on), `boardSurfaceName "board"`, `zFrameToleranceMm 1.0`
  (0 < tol <= 1.2: a height taken with the needle is 2.59 mm off, and only a tolerance below half of that always
  catches it), `surfaceMaxResidualMm 0.04` (below the gap),
  `surfaceMarginMm 3.5` (the bench probes 8 mm in from the board edge, the edge pads lie ~3 mm beyond),
  `needleOffsetMaxDriftMm 1.0`, `touchOffPrimeExtraClearanceMm 0.5`;
- needle XY: `needleXyTrim {dxMm 0, dyMm 0, setAtMs null, note null}` (within ±1 mm): the needle lands at camera +
  N2 head offset + trim, so every dispensed target is moved by minus the trim;
- motion: `travelFeedMmS 200`, `travelAccelMmS2 2000`, `zDownFeedMmS 50`, `zLiftFeedMmS 50`, `zLiftAccelMmS2 2000`
  (each <= 5000), `bMaxFeedDegS 2400` (sent as `M203 B`; <= 400 rpm, the Vieweg maximum), `bStepsPerDeg 4.44`
  (Marlin `M92 B`; one screw revolution of 1600 steps is 360.36°), `bStepsPerRev 1600`, `bExtrudeSign +1`,
  `honorBacklash true`, `commandTimeoutMs 10000`;
- manual prime / test dot at the waste place and calibration primes: `primeRotationDeg 360.36`, `testDotOffsetXMm 2`,
  `testDotOffsetYMm 0` (board runs purge on the purge row instead);
- keepalive: `keepaliveEnabled true`, `keepaliveWindowMs 3000` (>= 2 × interval), `keepaliveIntervalMs 1000`;
- interlocks: `maxContinuousOnTimeS 600` (I7), `pressureInterlockEnabled false`, `pressureMinPsi 1`,
  `pressureMaxPsi 19` (I5), `minPadTypeStatus "characterized"`, `refuseFlaggedPads true`;
- planning: `pasteThicknessMm 0.10`, `pasteDensityMgMm3 3.7` (informational / scale records),
  `includeDisabledPlacements true`, `twoOptMaxPasses 50`.

### `DispenseProfile` (`cfg.profile`): the recipe

One profile per pressure session, the same for the purge row and the work. Defaults = the bench's `p18_board1`:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `"18 psi half turn"` | |
| `pressurePsi` | 18 | A note: the regulator is set by hand (no sensor; I6). The window is narrow: 16 psi starved the screw, 20 psi drooled. Validated `0 < psi <= 21.7` (DV-5005 1.5 bar). |
| `netStepsPerDot` | 800 | Net screw turn per dot in motor steps (half a revolution). Must be 400, 800 or 1600 (a quarter, half or whole turn of the 1600 steps of a revolution): the start angle repeats and a purge dot (the profile's dose) turns at most one revolution plus the 20° phase turn, the stream validator's cap. Anything else is a validation problem: `profile netStepsPerDot must be 400, 800 or 1600 steps (a quarter, half or whole turn of the 1600 steps of a revolution): the start angle repeats and a purge dot turns at most one revolution` (`PUT /api/config` 400, the `CONFIG` interlock for a stored profile). |
| `suckBackDeg` | 10 | Suck-back after each dot, sent as `round(10 × 4.44)` = 44 steps. |
| `startAngleDeg` | 298 | Screw angle at which the first work dot starts (calibration). |
| `startAngleSetAtMs` | null | When it was set or confirmed; I11 needs it after the last controller connect. |
| `screwRpm` | 180 | B feed = rpm × 360 deg/min (`F64800`). <= 400 rpm and <= `bMaxFeedDegS`. |
| `screwAccelDegS2` | 20000 | Sent as `M204 S` around the B moves only (1000..30000). |
| `dwellMs` | 250 | Dwell after the forward turn, before the suck-back: the dot-size knob at fixed pressure. |
| `gapMm` | 0.10 | Needle-to-surface gap while dispensing (0.05..0.15; >= 0.20 misses dots). |
| `purgeDots` | 8 | Purge dots on the purge row before the work (>= 2 for a partial turn: the first sets the start angle, at least one normal dot flushes it). |
| `notes` | | Operator notes. |

Derived: `netDeg(c)` = 800 / 4.44 = 180.1802°, `forwardDeg(c)` = 844 / 4.44 = 190.0901°, `suckBackSteps(c)` = 44,
`revolutionsPerDot(c)` = 0.5, `feedDegS()` = 1080, `isPartialTurn(c)` (net steps not a multiple of 1600),
`startAngleSteps(c)` = `round(298 / 360 × 1600) mod 1600` = 1324 (297.9°), `startAngles(c)` = [297.9, 117.9],
`phaseSteps(c, restCount, dotsAfter)`, `static angleOfCount(count, stepsPerRev)` = `(count mod 1600) × 360 / 1600`,
`fingerprint()` (every field that changes a dot; a plan made on another profile is stale), `validate(c)`, `copy()`.

### `PurgeRow` (`cfg.purgeRow`, I9)

`surfaceName "blank"`, `x0Mm`, `y0Mm` (null = not set), `pitchXMm 2.5`, `pitchYMm 0`, `spots 0`, `usedSpots 0`,
`resetAtMs`. Spot i is at `(x0 + i·pitchX, y0 + i·pitchY)`; its Z is the `surfaceName` plane there + offset + gap.
`isDefined()`, `spotsLeft()`, `spot(i)`. A board run uses the next `profile.purgeDots` free spots and marks them used
right before its first line is sent (an aborted purge leaves them dirty). The pitch must be >= 1.5 mm. The bench row:
y 237.5, x0 292, pitch 2.5 (x 292..327, before the tape gap at x 331–339).

### `CleanPadCheck` (`cfg.cleanPadCheck`, I10)

`enabled true`, `grayLevel 200`, `minBrightFraction 0.8`, `boxWMm 0.806`, `boxHMm 0.807`. Before the pressure goes on,
the top camera is centred on every distinct work dot; the share of pixels brighter than `grayLevel` (OpenCV
`COLOR_BGR2GRAY`) in a `boxWMm × boxHMm` box at the frame centre must be >= `minBrightFraction` (the box is the bench's
where the pad, or the dot's grid cell, is at least about that large, as on 0603 pads of 0.80 × 0.95 mm; on smaller pads
it is 0.05 mm inside the pad edges, so a clean 0402 or fine-pitch pad is not read as dirty). Bare copper reads
>= 0.90; paste left from an earlier run reads dark blue, and so does solder mask (a mis-registered board). This is
`tools/disp.py --require-clean` (`[504:577, 923:998]` of a 1920×1080 frame at 0.01074 × 0.01106 mm/px) in mm, computed
by `vision.PadCleanCheck` through `DotImager.brightFraction` (a default method; fakes can override it).

### Registration, probe and homing (*autoreg*, `AUTO_REGISTER_DESIGN.md` §6.1)

- `homeBeforeRun "whenNeeded"` (or `"always"`): Register board, the blank probe and a board run home first when
  needed;
- `fiducialCheck {minFiducials 2 (2..10), searchRadiusMm 8.0 (1..12, at most 9 camera frames at the default camera
  size), seatToleranceMm 0.10 (0.01..1)}`: the radius bounds a fiducial's distance from its expected position (the
  board's last registration, else its nominal seat); the search frames tile that circle around the expected position
  (at most 9, the one nearest the prediction first), and a fit is compared with the board's last registration in the
  machine frame (the symmetric stretch of the polar decomposition, `FiducialLocator.machineFrame`), so a correct
  re-seat at another angle is not refused for the machine's own X/Y anisotropy;
- `vacuumProbe {startAboveMm 2.5, floorBelowMm 1.5, openAirMinCounts −1900000, openAirMaxCounts −1200000,
  alternates 4 (0..4), padKeepOutMm 1.4, vacuumSettleMs 1500, readDelayMs 70, boardSpots {}}` (`boardSpots`: board
  file name → 3..9 proven `[bx, by]` spots). Off the simulator a probe task refuses `vacuumSettleMs` below 1000 and
  `readDelayMs` below 65;
- engine-stamped (protected): `boardRegistrations` (the latest `BoardRegistration` per board key `file:<path>` or
  `job:<boardLocationId>`, at most 20, oldest dropped), `newSeatAtMs`;
- Z frames: `needleAnchor.homeAtMs`, `needleZOffsetHomeAtMs` (protected) and every surface's `homeAtMs`: the home each
  datum was measured under (null = unknown, saved before this). A surface also records `simulated`.
- `needleFloorZMm(Double surfaceReferenceZMm)`: the needle floor from the lower of the anchor surface and the
  surface's own reference (a board surface's board top Z), minus `zFrameToleranceMm`, plus the offset, minus 0.1.
  Purge dots keep the anchor's floor.

### Tip, paste and pad calibration (*profile*, `PROFILE_CALIBRATION_DESIGN.md` §5.4)

- `tip {key "ad22tta-b", name "22G tip", idMm 0.41, odMm 0.72, minDotSteps 400}`: pad types and dose records name it;
  the OD (an assumption until measured) sets the same-pad dot pitch; a dose below `minDotSteps` is not allowed;
- `paste {key "gc50-t5", name "Loctite GC50 SAC305 T5", lot, loadedAtMs}`;
- `calibrationArea {surfaceName "blank", x0Mm, y0Mm, widthMm, heightMm, usedMm, resetAtMs}` (unset: 40 × 20 mm at the
  blank place);
- `padCalibration {maxResidCv 0.13, maxHalfSplit 0.13, maxQuarterAmplitude 0.20, massTolLow 0.25, massTolHigh 0.10,
  confirmTolerance 0.05, controlTolerance 0.15, weighTargetMg 70, doseRecordMaxAgeH 8, readingConfirmAfterMin 15,
  couponPlaces ["coupon1", "coupon2"], couponSizeMm [40, 30], couponMarginMm 3, couponWindowMm 0.3, flushDots 4,
  ladderDotsPerPhase 12, minLadderDots 28, minHops 60, threadRateOk 0.03, missRateOk 0.005}`;
- `profile.sustainedFeedMgS 2.6` (the bench saw 2.56 mg/s at 18 psi); `profile.doseFingerprint()`,
  `DispenseProfile.fingerprintDiff(was, now)` (one text for "what changed"), `phaseSteps(c, rest, dotsAfter,
  stepsPerDot)` for a block of another dose.
- `PadCalibrationSettings.realMachineProblems()`: the shortened statistics a SIM test may set (`ladderDotsPerPhase`
  below 12, `minLadderDots` below 28, `minHops` below 60, `weighTargetMg` below 50), each as `padCalibration.minHops
  below 60 is allowed in the simulator only`; `PUT /api/config` refuses them off the simulator and a pad calibration
  refuses to start there while one is stored.

**Fixed controller commands** (`ControllerCommands`; not settings, schema 1 keys are ignored on load and refused by
`PUT /api/config`): pump `M106 P2 S255` / `M107 P2`, valve `M106 P3 S255` / `M107 P3`, left valve and pump OFF
`M107 P1` / `M107 P0` (off only: switching an output off is always safe), capability query `M115`
(`Cap:HOST_WATCHDOG:1`), watchdog `M990 S<keepaliveWindowMs>` / `M990` / `M990 S0`, and the Stop sequence
`STOP_SEQUENCE` = `stopSequence("B")` = `M410, M107 P3, M107 P2, M107 P1, M107 P0, M18 B` (the bench's F9, also the
machine.xml `DISABLE_COMMAND`). Every line the engine, its pings, its abort and the pressure hold send passes
`ControllerCommands.check()`: an allow-list of command words (`G0 G1 G4 G92 M18 M106 M107 M114 M115 M201 M203 M204
M400 M410 M990`), `M106` only as the two ON constants exactly, `M107` only as `P0`..`P3` exactly, no M42/M43 or other
output command. `GcodeStreamValidator` applies the same check, and refuses the probe's lines in a dispense program.
*autoreg:* `ControllerCommands.checkProbe()` is the N1 probe's gate: `check()`, or one of its exact lines (N1 pump
`M106`, N1 valve `M106 P1 S180`, the VAC1 sensor set-up and select `M260 …`, the read `M261 A109 B3 S1`). The probe's
I/O goes through `DispenseExecutor`'s gate (the abort flag checked before every line).

Coordinates: X/Y are OpenPnP machine coordinates of the N2 needle tip (what `N2.moveTo()` takes); the stream goes to
X/Y minus `needleXyTrim`. Surface Z (places, board, surfaces) is in OpenPnP's frame: the N1 nozzle Z touching the
surface. Dispense Z (N2) = surface Z + `needleZOffsetMm` + `profile.gapMm`; on a board the surface Z of each dot is the
probed `board` plane at the dot, on the purge row the `blank` plane; hop Z = dispense Z + `hopHeightMm`. On the Lumen
(z2 = 63 − raw, K 65.59) the needle dispenses at raw Z = 65.49 − c for a surface at N1 contact c. B is degrees of the
auger (Marlin units).

## 3. Data (`<configDir>/instancelabs/dispense.db`, SQLite, every table append-only via triggers)

| Signature | Notes |
|---|---|
| `public DispenseDb getDb()` | Direct access; `DispenseDb.query(String sql, Object... args)` returns `List<Map<String,Object>>`. `recentRuns(int)`, `recentEvents(int)`. |
| `public List<PadType> getPadTypes() throws SQLException` | Current version of each type, creation order. Seeds (§5.7): chip-0402/0603/0805/1206, sod-123, sot-23, soic, tssop, qfp, qfn-dfn-perimeter, qfn-centre (k 0.5), custom; all `not-started`. |
| `public PadType savePadType(PadType p) throws SQLException` | Appends version n+1 (new key = new type, i.e. "New pad type"). Status: `not-started → provisional → characterized → validated`. |
| `public PadRule savePadRule(PadRule r) throws SQLException` | Per-type layout rule: `largestSingleDotPadMm2` and `maxDots` (a pad larger than that gets a grid, §4). |
| `public Calibration getCurrentCalibration() throws SQLException` | Scale records and dot-ladder rows hang off a calibration record (seed #1). The planner no longer uses it (no q model). |
| `public List<DotLadderRow> getDotLadder(long calibrationId) throws SQLException` | |
| `public Calibration recordScaleShots(ScaleCalibration.ShotsEntry e) throws SQLException` | Manual scale entry (§5.2): per-shot masses or total mass + count. |
| `public DotLadderRow recordScaleDots(ScaleCalibration.DotsEntry e) throws SQLException` | Dot batch on a coupon: mg/dot, SE = √2·s_scale/n, spherical-cap height. |

Tables: `pad_types`, `pad_rules`, `package_pad_type` (package → type overrides, `DispenseDb.mapPackage(String, String)`),
`calibration`, `dot_ladder`, `pad_plan`, `runs` (per-run timings, dots, `dph_motion`, `dph_overall`), `dot_log`
(per-dot host timestamps), `events` (also `PROFILE` per run, `I9` purge spots used / reset, `I10` clean checks, `I11`
start angle; *autoreg:* `REG` with each registration's JSON, `PROBE` with each probe's points and looks, `ZCHECK`),
`needle_touchoff`, `scale_entries`, view `pad_types_current`. `runs.kind` adds `board-registration`, `surface-probe`
and `z-check`.

*Profile:* `dispense.db` schema 2 (`SCHEMA_VERSION`, table `schema_info`). A schema-1 file is first copied next to
itself (`dispense.db.v1-<time>.bak`), then one transaction adds the nullable columns `pad_types.dot_steps`,
`dots_per_pad`, `tip_key`, `dose_fp`, `cal_area_mm2`, `mass_per_pad_mg`, `origin`, `package_pad_type.pad_names` (a
mapping of some pads of a package: `mapPackage(String, Collection<String>, String)`), `runs.skipped_pads`, and the
append-only tables `dose_records` (optical, coupon and mass records of a dose), `pad_calibrations` (one row per
calibrated type) and `package_options` (decision 4's `paste_partial`: `setPastePartial`, `pastePartialPackages`). A
second open is a no-op. Dose records: `insertDoseRecord`, `doseRecord(id)`, `doseRecords(steps, sinceMs)`,
`pendingCoupons(sinceMs)` (coupon records without a mass row yet); `insertPadCalibration`, `padCalibrations(typeKey,
limit)`. `runs.kind` adds `pad-ladder` and `pad-weigh`; `events` add `PCAL` (each calibration, the area used, each
job's end).

## 4. Planning

| Signature | Notes |
|---|---|
| `public DispensePlan planBoard(BoardLocation bl) throws Exception` | Pads from `packages.xml` footprint pads if present, else from the pad type layout. Uses `Utils2D.calculateBoardPlacementLocation`, i.e. the fiducial-corrected local→global transform when a fiducial check has set one. Bottom-up boards: `IllegalArgumentException`. Sets `plan.boardFingerprint`, stores `pad_plan` rows. |
| `public DispensePlan planBoard(BoardLocation bl, BoardRegistration reg) throws Exception` | *autoreg.* Plans `reg == null ? bl : reg.applyTo(bl)`: the pads follow the registration's board → machine affine, the board Z stays the nominal seat's (`plan.boardZMm`, the reference I4 checks a board surface against). Refused (`IllegalStateException`, a 409 at the API) when `boardZProblem` says the board top cannot be an N1 contact height. `plan.boardFingerprint` and `plan.boardRegistration` are computed on the registered location. |
| `public DispensePlan planBoardFile(File boardFile, Location boardLocation) throws Exception` | Loads a `.board.xml` and plans it top-side up at `boardLocation`. (The API now plans file boards through `planBoard(bl, reg)` too.) |
| `public DispensePlanner newPlanner() throws SQLException` | `new DispensePlanner(cfg, resolver).withRules(rules).withSurface(plane)`; `plan(String boardName, List<PadGeometry> pads, double startX, double startY)` for custom pad lists. |
| `public static List<GcodeStreamBuilder.DotSpec> purgeSpecs(DispenseConfig c)` | The next `profile.purgeDots` free purge spots as dot specs (index `PURGE_INDEX` = −3), or empty if the row cannot supply them (I9 refuses then). *Profile:* `purgeSpecs(c, plan)` = the spots a run of that plan lays (`DoseBlocks.purgeSpotsNeeded`: the initial purge, then a phase dot for a partial turn and `padCalibration.flushDots` flush dots before every further dose block); `purgeSpecs(c, n)`. |
| `public InterlockReport checkInterlocks(DispensePlan plan, double estimatedPressurisedSeconds)` | Pre-flight only; `runPlan` re-checks with the program's own estimate. |

There is no dose model: the volumetric chain (q per revolution, ladder interpolation) was removed after the bench
showed the dose follows the turn, the pressure and the dwell. Every dot is one profile dot: `rotationDeg` =
`profile.netDeg` (180.1802° for 800 steps). `DotSizer.layout(w, h, area, rule)`: one dot per pad, or, for a pad larger
than its rule's `largestSingleDotPadMm2`, `ceil(area / largestSingleDotPadMm2)` dots (capped by `maxDots`, default 6)
on the grid that maximises the short side of a cell (`bestGrid`). Order: nearest neighbour from the start + 2-opt; the
start is the last purge spot of the next run (so the cross is short), else N2's XY.

`DispensePlan` carries `profile` (a copy) and `profileFingerprint`, `needleGapMm`, `needleZOffsetMm`, `hopHeightMm`,
`surfaceFingerprint`, `boardFingerprint`, `pads`, `dots`, `warnings`, path lengths. `PlannedDot`: `index`, `padId`,
`xMm`, `yMm`, `surfaceZMm`, `dispenseZMm`, `hopZMm`, `rotationDeg`. `PlannedPad`: geometry, type, area, target volume
and mass (informational), `dotCount`, `rotationPerDotDeg`, `flags`. Blocking flags: `NO_PAD_TYPE`, `STATUS_BELOW_MIN`
(§5.7 rule), `NO_GEOMETRY`.

*Board import.* A board plan also carries the board frame: `boardToMachine` (6 affine numbers), `boardFile`,
`boardWidthMm`, `boardHeightMm`, `boardTransformStatus`, `fiducials` (`id`, `partId`, board and machine X/Y),
`boardArtId` / `boardArtKind` / `boardArtNote` (the drawing, fixed by the API when the plan is made), and per pad
`padName`, `partId`, `roundness`, and the rule that chose its type (`typeRule`, `typeRuleDetail`, `typeRuleMatched`,
from `PadTypeResolver.explain`). `copyBoardFieldsTo(sub)` keeps them on run subsets. The board fingerprint includes a
digest of the board's content (`BoardContentDigest`), so a board imported again with other pads makes the plan stale.
`GcodeProgram.dotArriveSeconds` / `dotEndSeconds`: each dot's arrive and end on the program's clock (the path
preview).

*Profile.* A pad type may carry its own dose: `PadType.dotSteps` (a quarter, half or whole turn, 400 / 800 / 1600 steps,
at or above the tip's `minDotSteps`) and `dotsPerPad`; without them a pad gets the profile's dot as before. `PlannedPad`
adds `dotSteps`, `dotsPerPad`, `startPhase`, `typeTipKey`; `PlannedDot` adds `netSteps`, `block` and `padIndex`;
`DispensePlan.blocks` lists the runs of consecutive dots of one dose (`index`, `netSteps`, `turn`, `dots`, `pads`,
`firstDot`, `lastDot`, `phaseDot`, `flushDots`, `demandMgS`). The planner keeps a pad's dots together, forms one block
per dose (the profile's dose first, then descending; nearest neighbour + 2-opt inside each block, from where the block
starts on the purge row), and holds back a pad that is too close to a neighbour for its dots (`MAY_BRIDGE`, decision 14
of PC §20.1: per pad, not per group). A type calibrated with another tip is `STATUS_BELOW_MIN` with the tip in its text
(decision 16). `DoseBlocks` (pure): `isAllowed`, `dosesOf(plan, profileSteps)`, `purgeSpotsNeeded`, `fillDemand`.

## 5. Execution

| Signature | Notes |
|---|---|
| `public Future<RunResult> runBoard(BoardLocation bl) throws Exception` | `planBoard` + `runPlan`. |
| `public Future<RunResult> runPlan(DispensePlan plan) throws Exception` | Never completes exceptionally for dispense failures: inspect `RunResult.status` (`OK`, `ABORTED`, `ERROR`, `REFUSED`), `message`, `interlocks`. |
| `public Future<PadCleanReport> checkCleanPads(DispensePlan plan) throws Exception` | The clean-pad guard alone (camera only, pressure off), so the operator can wipe before a run. A run repeats it. Refused at its start (a STOP since it was queued, the machine not started, the pressure hold on): the returned report is empty (`ok` false, no pads, `checkedAtMs` 0, `isComplete()` false) and the reason is the run's (`getLastRun()`, `status.run`). |
| `public Future<RunResult> runShots(String locationName, double rotationDeg, int count, boolean referenceSurface) throws Exception` | Manual prime / test dot at the waste place (`referenceSurface` true: the place is checked against the needle frame) and the scale workflow (shots into a cup: only the floor). Full I4. |

| `public void abort(String reason)` | Thread-safe. The stream stops before its next line and sends the Stop sequence (I1). Also triggered by OpenPnP Stop/disable. |

| `public void setPressureSensor(BarrelPressureSensor s)` | I5 hook (`Double readPsi()`); no sensor fitted yet. |
| `public void setDotImager(DotImager imager)` | Override the camera/vision (default: top camera + `CameraCapture`/`DotInspector`; `brightFraction` for I10). |
| `public Future<RegistrationResult> registerBoard(RegisterRequest req) throws Exception` | *autoreg.* Register board (`AUTO_REGISTER_DESIGN.md` §5.2): home if needed, the fiducials (`FiducialLocator`, the light on), the seat (`first` / `same` / `reseated`, §3.6), then for `probe` `AUTO` / `ALWAYS` the N1 probe of the board targets (`ProbeTargets`, each spot looked at first with `BareSpotCheck`) or, for a same seat with a tied surface, 3 stored points touched again; the surface saved tied to the registration; then `req.replanner` plans again. `RegisterRequest`: `plan`, `nominal`, `boardKey`, `nominalSeat`, `planToBoard`, `nominalZ`, `probe` (`AUTO` \| `ALWAYS` \| `NEVER`), `replanner`. Never completes exceptionally for registration failures: `RegistrationResult.ok`, `message`, `stoppedStage`, `run` (a `RunResult` of kind `board-registration`). |
| `public Future<SurfaceProbeResult> probeSurface(SurfaceProbeRequest req) throws Exception` | *autoreg.* The automatic N1 probe of a needle-frame surface (the blank): `surfaceName`, `nominalZ`, `targets` (null: either side of the purge row, `ProbeTargets.forRow`). Saves the plane when it fits. |
| `public Future<RunResult> checkZ() throws Exception` | *autoreg.* One N1 touch at a point measured before the last home (kind `z-check`): passes within `ZCheck.TOLERANCE_MM` 0.03 mm; a pass vouches for the data of that point's Z frame (§7, I4). A failed check ("Z moved") refuses every task whose Z data predate the home, with the remedy, which works under the same home in this order: `Record the needle frame again (Setup › Needle Z frame), probe the blank, touch off and register the board again.` A needle frame recorded after the home replaces the touch-off it covers (`ZCheck.touchOffReplaced`: the touch-off is no Z datum any more, and I4 asks for a new one); data not measured again keep the refusal. The blank probed again after a home keeps the points it replaces as a reference of their Z frame (`SurfaceMap.replaced`, `ZCheck.kept`; one frame kept), so a later check of older data still has a point to touch. Places carry no time: after "Z moved" retake the waste place's Z with N1 too. |
| `public HomeReport homeSafely() throws Exception` | *autoreg.* OpenPnP's home on the machine thread with N1 raised Z-only to the travel Z first when a STOP left it low; a STOP during the home disconnects the drivers. `{needed, whyCode, why, done, seconds, n1RaisedFromZ}`. Every engine task that may move calls `homeIfNeeded` first (`homeBeforeRun`). |
| `public VacuumProber.Window probePreflight(boolean board, String what, double nominalZ)` · `public ZCheckPlan zCheckPlan(DispensePlan plan, boolean homeFirst)` · `public InterlockReport checkBasicInterlocks(boolean homeFirst)` | *autoreg.* The checks the API runs before 202: the probe window (start = nominal + `startAboveMm`, floor = the higher of the nominal and the anchor − `floorBelowMm`, refused against the needle frame), whether Z must be checked and where, and the interlocks of a task without a plan. A floor at or above the board top is refused before anything moves (`PROBE: the board top Z 3.500 lies 2.000 mm under the needle-frame surface 5.500, and the probe goes at most 1.5 mm under the higher of the two (down to Z 4.000): it cannot reach that height. Set the board top Z to roughly the N1 contact height, or record the needle frame again; if both are right, probe by hand`): planning accepts a board top up to 2.0 mm from the anchor, so a board 1.5 to 2.0 mm under it is probed by hand. A weigh coupon's window is ±`couponWindowMm` around its own place Z (`Window.narrow`), never the needle frame's. |
| `public Future<DoseBlocksResult> runDoseBlocks(DoseBlocksRequest req) throws Exception` | *profile.* One engine step of a pad calibration (PC §7.3), `runs.kind` `pad-ladder` (test dots on the calibration area of the blank) or `pad-weigh` (weigh dots on the coupons): refuses at its start when a STOP came after `req.stopEpoch`, a dose the tip does not take (`PCAL: 533 steps is not a dot the 22G tip takes …`), a coupon place unset or carrying dots still to be weighed, a coupon touched before the last home with no Z check since (`I4: the 'coupon1' coupon was touched before the home at 13:02, …: touch it again before laying dots on it`); homes if needed; the basic interlocks and I4 on the area's or the coupon's surface; then, pressure off, the top camera looks at every spot in tiles (`PadLadder.tiles`: each spot ≥ 2 mm inside a frame) and refuses everything if one spot is not bare (`the calibration area is not clean or not flat under 3 of the dots …`; no camera: `the pad calibration needs the top camera …`); stamps the area's band as used (`areaReserveMm`) before streaming; one pressure session with `GcodeStreamBuilder.forBlocks` (the M114 count is required for a partial turn: `I11: the controller did not report the B step count (M114 Count): …. Nothing was sent.`); the after frames: every dot found (`DotInspector`), its landing offset, the screw phase it started at (by the count), a thread to the next dot (the corridor between them), three crops per block (`Crop`: the first dot, the median one and the worst one or a miss, before and after, PNG); parks N2 at the travel Z over the next unused purge spot. `DoseBlocksResult`: `ok`, `message`, `home`, `zCheck`, `stoppedStage`, `bCountAtStart`, `blocks` (`BlockOut`: `netSteps`, `label`, `couponPlace`, `hopMm`, `dots` (`DotOut`: `x`, `y`, `startCount`, `phase`, `found`, `dxMm`, `dyMm`, `threadToNext`, `string`)), `crops`, `refusedSpots`, `frames`, `run`. Never completes exceptionally for task failures. |
| `public GcodeProgram estimateBlocks(List<DoseBlocksRequest.Block> blocks) throws Exception` | *profile.* The program a dose-blocks step would stream, for the before-start time and the I7/I6-feed checks. |
| `public long stopEpoch()` | *profile.* Incremented by every STOP (`abort`): a step queued before it refuses at its start (`StopEpochTest`). |
| `public String couponReservation(String place)` · `public static boolean weighable(DoseRecord coupon, long nowMs, DispenseConfig c, DoseRecord.Epochs e)` | *profile.* Why no step may lay dots on or probe a coupon place now (`coupon1 carries 136 dots waiting to be weighed: type the readings or skip them (Calibrate › Pad calibration)`), else null; whether a coupon record's reading would still be a fresh mass record (the recipe, regulator, tip, paste, age and simulator flag; a reconnect does not change what lies on a coupon). |
| `public synchronized PadCalibrationRecord applyPadCalibration(PadCalibrationRecord rec, PadType version) throws SQLException` | *profile.* Writes one pad type's outcome (PC §7.7): the type's new version (when the calibration wrote one) and the `pad_calibrations` row, with a `PCAL` event. A `characterized` version needs a record whose every check passed; a calibration never writes `validated` (`IllegalArgumentException`). |

Every engine task (`runPlan`, `runShots`, `runDotLadder`, `runNeedleTouchOff`, `checkCleanPads`, `runDoseBlocks`, the
registration, the probes and `checkZ`) checks at its start, on the machine thread, a STOP since it was queued, that
the machine is started, and the pressure hold (`refuseWhilePressureHeld` inside `submit` / `submitResult`): a hold
switched on after the API's own check refuses it REFUSED with `the pressure hold is on: Pressure off first`.

What `runPlan` does, in order:
1. Refuses (REFUSED, nothing sent, before the session opens) if the profile's fingerprint differs from the plan's: plan
   the board again. Every other check first, with the home and the Z check as notes (*autoreg*); then it homes if
   needed (`homeIfNeeded`, `RunResult.homedFirst`) and checks Z when Z data predate the last home (`zCheckIfNeeded`,
   `RunResult.zCheck`; a failed check ends the run REFUSED before any pressure).
2. Waits for OpenPnP motion to complete; sends `M115` (the host-watchdog keepalive is used only if a response line
   contains `Cap:HOST_WATCHDOG:1`; a pending controller error refuses the run, un-zeroes B and un-homes the machine).
3. Interlocks (I3, I4 with the board and purge surfaces, I5, I6 note, I9, I10, I11, plan rules), then builds the
   program once with a B count of 0 for the estimate and checks again with its pressurised time (I7).
4. With `cleanPadCheck.enabled`: the top camera at every distinct work dot, pressure off. Any dirty or off-pad target
   refuses the run with the I10 list (`RunResult.cleanCheck`).
5. Waits for motion again, reads the B step count: `M400`, `M114`, `parseBCount` (`Count ... B:<n>`). OpenPnP's
   simulator does not report it: on a loopback TCP link the count is taken as 0 with the run warning "simulated
   controller (no M114 Count): B step count taken as 0 for the start angle". On a real link without a count a
   partial-turn profile is refused (I11, nothing sent).
6. Builds the session through `OpenPnpRawMapper` (= `nozzle.toRaw(nozzle.toHeadLocation(loc))`, soft limits via
   `MotionPlanner.isValidLocation`) and `BacklashEmulator` (reproduces `AbstractMotionPlanner.createBacklashCompensatedMotion`),
   validates it with `GcodeStreamValidator`, marks the purge spots used, then streams it line by line via
   `GcodeDriver.sendCommand()` (the driver's own flow control/error regex).
7. Re-syncs OpenPnP: X/Y/Z planned and driver coordinates, the motion planner's directional-backlash state, B = 0.
8. Stores `runs` + `dot_log`, fires `onFinished`. `RunResult.purgeDots`, `bCountAtStart`, `workStartAngleDeg`.

One pressure session per board (`GcodeStreamBuilder.forPlan(cfg, mapper, plan, List<DotSpec> purge, boolean bZeroed,
boolean keepalive, Long bCount)`; *profile:* it builds `forBlocks(cfg, mapper, List<BlockSpec>, …)`, one block per
dose, each after the first preceded on the purge row by a phase dot (partial turns) and `flushDots` flush dots of the
new dose):
```
G92 B0                 ; only if B not zeroed since home/reconnect (I2)
M201 B<screwAccelDegS2> / M203 B<bMaxFeedDegS> / M204 S<travelAccelMmS2>
M990 S3000             ; only with the capability; then M990 every keepaliveIntervalMs, long G4s split
G1 Z<travel> / G0 X.. Y..   ; to the first purge spot at travelSafeZ (+ OpenPnP's backlash approach moves)
M106 P2 S255 / G4 P<pumpToValveSettleMs> / M106 P3 S255 / G4 P<valveSettleMs>
<purge dots>           ; the per-dot block on the purge row; the first one sets the phase (below)
G1 Z<travel> / G0 X.. Y..   ; cross to the first work dot: no M400, no G4 (a pause under pressure oozes paste)
<work dots>
M400 / M107 P3 / M107 P2 / M990 S0 / G92 B0 / G1 Z<travelSafeZ> / M400
```
Per dot (purge and work alike):
```
G0 X.. Y..             ; at the current (hop) height
G1 Z<dispense> F<zDownFeedMmS·60>
M204 S<screwAccelDegS2>                  ; 20000: only the B moves run under it
G1 B<rest + net + suck> F<screwRpm·360>  ; forward: 844 steps = 190.0901°
G4 P<dwellMs>
G1 B<rest + net> F<screwRpm·360>         ; suck-back: 44 steps
M204 S<zLiftAccelMmS2>                   ; 2000 (M204 S also caps B, and governs X/Y/Z)
G1 Z<hop> F<zLiftFeedMmS·60>
```
B targets are absolute from the session's `G92 B0`: origin + steps / `bStepsPerDeg`, printed `%.4f`, always whole
motor steps (Marlin rounds each absolute target to steps), so the screw rests exactly `netStepsPerDot` further after
every dot and the start angle repeats (298, 118, 298, … for half turns). `dot(spec)` rounds `rotationDeg × 4.44` to
steps; `dot(spec, netSteps)` takes steps.

**Phase lock.** Screw angle = (Marlin step count of B mod 1600) × 360 / 1600. The step count is counted since
controller power-up and is not reset by `G92 B` (Marlin workspace offset; to be confirmed on the Lumen firmware, see
`REAL_MACHINE_TODO.md`), so the start angle is a calibration of the current power-up (`startAngleSetAtMs` after
`controllerConnectedAtMs`, I11). The first purge dot turns `profile.phaseSteps(c, restCount, purgeDots − 1)` steps:
the turn that, after the remaining purge dots, leaves the screw at `startAngleSteps` for the first work dot (at least
20°, at most one revolution more); the remaining purge dots flush that odd-sized dot. Example (count 0, 298°, 8
purge dots): first purge dot 524 steps (forward 568), then 7 × 800, first work dot at count 6124 = 297.9°.
`GcodeProgram` reports `purgeDotCount`, `bCountAtStart`, `workStartCount`, `workStartAngleDeg`.

**Stop / abort / error (I1).** `abortLines` = `ControllerCommands.stopSequence(B)` (`M410, M107 P3, M107 P2, M107 P1,
M107 P0, M18 B`), then `M990 S0` if armed, each through `GcodeChannel.sendCritical` (a controller error that is still
pending makes GcodeDriver refuse a line without sending it; critical lines are sent again). Then `M400`,
`M204 S<travelAccelMmS2>` (a stop between the screw's `M204 S` and the restore leaves 20000 in force), `M114` read-back,
OpenPnP re-synced to the reported position, machine marked un-homed (M410 may lose steps), B marked not zeroed. The
abort flag is checked again right before every line (also after a keepalive ping), and OpenPnP's Stop waits up to
50 ms for a line that already passed its check to be written, so no engine motion line follows the driver's
`DISABLE_COMMAND`. No `M410` at a normal session end: after `M400` nothing is left to stop, and stock Marlin holds
`M410`'s `ok` for about 1 s (planner clean-up), which kept the valve open 1 s after the last dot.

`GcodeStreamValidator` refuses a program with: a line `ControllerCommands.check()` refuses (and any N1 vacuum or I2C
line: they belong to the probe); valve ON before pump ON or pump OFF while the valve is ON; *profile:* a dot whose turn
differs from its plan's, is not an allowed dose or is below the tip's smallest, two doses without a block start between
them, a block that does not start at the start angle, a pad whose dots are split (a dot's pad is the planner's
`PlannedDot.padIndex`, so two pads of one name in a footprint are two pads; the pad id only for a plan made without the
index), a purge dot of more than one revolution plus the 20° phase turn, a program that turns the screw more than its plan allows; a B move before `G92 B0`
(I2) or outside a pressure session; any G0/G1 with a non-B axis word while the last `M204 S` exceeds
`max(travelAccelMmS2, zLiftAccelMmS2)` ("X/Y/Z move under the screw acceleration"); a B feed above `bMaxFeedDegS × 60`;
an `M400` inside a dot; a raw Z outside the window between the I4 needle floor and the travel Z; pneumatics ON or the
watchdog armed at the end.

`GcodeProgram.estimatedSeconds` / `estimatedPressurisedSeconds`: moves as trapezoids at the M204 in force (B at
`min(M204 S, M201 B)`), dwells; no look-ahead or host latency. `estimatedWorkSeconds`: from the cross after the purge
to the last dot's lift, the window the bench's DPH is timed over (web UI: "dots only"; the whole program is
"overall"). Against the bench's p18_board1 the move model is about 3 % slow.

`RunResult`: `runId`, `kind` (`board`/`shots`/`dot-ladder`/`touch-off`/`clean-check`; *autoreg*
`board-registration`/`surface-probe`/`z-check`), `status`, `message`, `startedAtMs`, `endedAtMs`, `dotsPlanned`,
`dotsDone` (work dots), `firstDotStartMs`, `lastDotEndMs`, `dotTimings` (`dotIndex`, `padId`, `rotationDeg`, `startMs`,
`endMs`; work dots), `keepaliveActive`, `keepalivePings`, `linesSent`, `streamedLines`, `warnings`, `interlocks`,
`profile` (the copy used), `cleanCheck` (`PadCleanReport`), `purgeDots`, `bCountAtStart`, `workStartAngleDeg`, *autoreg*
`homedFirst`, `zCheck`, `nextPlanId`, `Double dphMotion()` = dots / (lastDotEnd − firstDotStart) · 3600, `Double
dphOverall()` = dots / (end − start) · 3600. Timestamps are host-side: a dot's `endMs` is when its last line was
acknowledged (queued in Marlin, not executed); `lastDotEndMs` is the completion of the `M400` that follows the last dot
(true completion).

`PadCleanReport`: `planId`, `ok`, `grayLevel`, `minBrightFraction`, `boxWMm`, `boxHMm`, `checkedAtMs`, `pads`
(`padId`, `dotIndex`, `xMm`, `yMm`, `brightFraction`, `clean`, `error`, `boxWMm`, `boxHMm` used at that dot),
`dirtyPadIds()`, `refusal()`, `isComplete()` (`checkedAtMs > 0`: false for a check that was stopped or failed).

## 6. Calibration

| Signature | Notes |
|---|---|
| `public Future<DotLadderCalibration.Result> runDotLadder(DotLadderCalibration.Request req) throws Exception` | Request: `rotationsDeg` (default 30/45/58/75/90), `repeats` 5, `pitchMm` 1.5, `locationName` (default blank), `primeAtWaste`. Every dot at the probed blank plane under it + offset + gap (the profile's suck-back, dwell and screw feed). Before images (pressure off) → one pressure session → after images → `DotInspector` → one `dot_ladder` row per rotation on the current calibration record. Requires I4 (incl. the blank surface). |
| `public Future<DispenseService.TouchOffResult> runNeedleTouchOff(NeedleTouchOff.Request req, boolean apply) throws Exception` | §6.1 option 1. Gaps `startGapMm` 0.125 down by `stepMm` 0.025, `steps` 6, relative to the current offset, each above the probed blank plane at that dot; `rotationDeg` NaN (default) = one profile dot. Contact = midpoint between the last normal dot and the first squashed (`> (1+jumpRatio)·reference`) or missing one; new offset = old + contact. `apply` writes it (sets `needleZOffsetSetAtMs`, clears I4). The only I4 waiver (named): it needs the needle frame and the blank surface; while not touched off its prime is `touchOffPrimeExtraClearanceMm` higher. |
| `recordScaleShots` / `recordScaleDots` | See §3. |

Pure helpers usable without a machine: `DispenseProfile.*` (`phaseSteps`, `startAngles`, `angleOfCount`, `validate`),
`NeedleTouchOff.analyze(double[] gapsMm, Double[] diametersMm, double jumpRatio)`, `DotLadderCalibration.analyze(...)`,
`DotSizer.layout(...)`, `DotMath.*`, `DispenseService.parseBCount(List<String>, String)` (package-private),
`GcodeStreamBuilder.forPlan(...)` / `forDots(...)` / `abortLines(...)`, `vision.PadCleanCheck.measure(...)`.

*Profile:* **dose records and the pad calibration** (PC §1.7, §7). Every engine step and every reading writes a
`DoseRecord` (append-only `dose_records`): `optical` (a ladder block on the blank: dots, found, misses, hops,
threads, area mean, residual CV, diameters, per-phase statistics, drift, landing), `coupon` (the weigh dots on a
coupon: the same camera statistics and the place) and `mass` (the readings of a coupon record: full, empty, total,
mg per dot, mg per step, the record it confirms within `confirmTolerance` 5 %; a skipped weighing is a mass row
without readings). A record is evidence only for the setup it was made in: `whyStale(nowMs, cfg, epochs)` gives the
first rule that fails (the simulator flag, the dose recipe `profile.doseFingerprint()`, the attested regulator psi,
the tip, the needle change, the paste and its load, `doseRecordMaxAgeH` 8 h; for optical and coupon records of a
partial turn also the controller's connect and the start angle). `DoseRecords.evidence(records, cfg, epochs, now)`
pools every fresh record of a dose into a `padprofile.DoseEvidence` (`LadderStats`: the transfer, threads against
`k95`, the repeat CV, the half-turn split or the quarter-turn harmonic fit, drift, landing; the mass readings and
whether two confirm each other); a failed record is not erased by a later passing one. The mass per dot of a reading
is its total over the dots laid on the coupon (PC §7.5; the dots the camera found still set the plausibility check's
expected mass). `padprofile.Decider` decides each group from that evidence (`characterized` only when every check
passes: optical, mass confirmed, amount within −25 %/+10 %, R6, geometry, the control dot, tip, regulator, not
validated; a fallback plan stays `provisional`, `validated` is never written), and the API's job writes it with
`applyPadCalibration`. The job itself (steps, readings, the result) is the API's `PadCalibrationJob` (`WEB_API.md`
§3.5). Pure helpers: `PadLadder` (doses, pitch, the area's band, camera tiles, bare looks, crops, the corridor thread
test), `WeighPlan` (the dots per coupon for `weighTargetMg`, their grid inside the coupon margin, the coupon looks and
touches, which dose goes on which coupon; `within`: whether a new grid stays inside the margin the camera checked,
else the job's post-ladder reweigh keeps the checked grid and dose and says so), `DoseRecords`, and the `padprofile` package (`DoseModel`, `DotGeometry`,
`LadderStats`, `ProfileCheck`, `Suggester`, `Decider`, `Texts`, `Limits`).

## 7. Interlocks (§5.5)

| Id | Where | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| I1 | `DispenseExecutor.shutdown` | The Stop sequence (F9) on any error, abort, I7 trip, OpenPnP Stop/disable (machine listener). Each line attempted, through `sendCritical`. The web status reports `stopCommandCheck`: OpenPnP's own Stop is OK only if the driver's `DISABLE_COMMAND` contains the exact contiguous F9 sequence. |
| I2 | `GcodeStreamBuilder` + `GcodeStreamValidator` | No B move before `G92 B0`; flag cleared on home, enable, disable, abort. |
| I3 | `Interlocks` | Refuses if N2 has compatible nozzle tips or a loaded tip (names reported). |
| I4 | `Interlocks` (+ builder floor, validator Z window) | *autoreg:* a board surface tied to a plan is checked against the plan's board top Z, every other surface and place against the needle-frame anchor (one reference per surface, `AUTO_REGISTER_DESIGN.md` §16 item 1); a surface probed on the simulator is refused on a machine that is not. **Z after a home:** the needle frame, the touch-off and the surfaces measured before the last home are accepted only after a passing Z check for this home that vouches for each of them (a touch vouches only for data of its own Z frame); a failed check refuses (`I4: Z moved …`); a task that homes or checks Z first gets a note instead. Before: refuses without a needle Z frame recorded since the last needle change; unless touched off since the change and the frame (named waiver: the touch-off run); if the offset is more than `needleOffsetMaxDriftMm` from the frame's; if a waste/blank place Z or any surface point is more than `zFrameToleranceMm` from the frame surface; board / ladder runs: without the probed surface, with a plane residual above `surfaceMaxResidualMm`, with a dot more than `surfaceMarginMm` outside the probed hull, (board) a plan made on another surface map, or a board surface probed on another board registration (`boardFingerprint`). The purge row's surface gets the same checks for the purge spots (`Scope.moreSurfaces`). Hard floor: no dot below frame surface − tolerance + offset − 0.1. |
| I5 | `Interlocks` | Pressure window via `BarrelPressureSensor`; disabled by default. |
| I6 | `Interlocks` (note) | The regulator is set by hand to `profile.pressurePsi` (18); reported with every check. *Profile:* **I6-feed** refuses a plan or a dose-blocks step whose block asks the screw for more paste per second than `profile.sustainedFeedMgS` (2.6 mg/s, the bench's 2.56 at 18 psi): `I6: block 2 (one turn) asks the screw for 3.07 mg/s; the most it was seen to keep up with at 18.0 psi is 2.60 mg/s: lengthen the dwell or use more, smaller dots`. |
| I7 | `Interlocks` (estimate) + `DispenseExecutor` (runtime) | Max continuous pump+valve on-time. |
| I9 | `Interlocks` (board runs) | Purge row defined and at least `profile.purgeDots` free spots; *profile:* the spots the plan's blocks need (`DoseBlocks.purgeSpotsNeeded`), named per switch. |
| I10 | `Interlocks` + `runPlan` (board runs) | With `cleanPadCheck.enabled`: a top camera must be available, and the clean-pad check must pass right before the pressure goes on. |
| I11 | `Interlocks` (board runs, partial-turn profile) | `profile.startAngleSetAtMs` must exist and be >= `controllerConnectedAtMs` (set or confirm after every connect); `runPlan` also refuses when the controller does not report the B step count. *Profile:* also when any block of the plan is a partial turn. |
| MACHINE | `Interlocks` | *autoreg:* "not homed" is a note (`MACHINE: not homed: homes first`) when the task homes first (`homeFirst`); "not enabled" always refuses (nothing presses Start for the operator). |
| PLAN | `Interlocks` | Blocked pads (`… pad(s) not dispensable: …`, a note `… flagged pad(s) will be skipped` with `refuseFlaggedPads: false`), a plan with no dots. *Profile:* a pad type whose dose the tip does not take (`pad type x v2 has … dots; the 22G tip takes quarter, half or one-turn dots (a quarter turn at least): edit it and plan again`), a pad of less than half a turn in a row (R6: `… gives each pad 400 steps (a quarter turn); every pad needs at least half a screw turn in a row …`), and a plan made before the tip, the gate, a pad type or a mapping changed (`the tip changed after planning: …`, `the pad-type gate changed after planning: …`, `pad types or package mappings changed after planning (…); plan again`). A type calibrated with another tip is `STATUS_BELOW_MIN` (decision 16); a pad too close to a neighbour for its dots is held back as `MAY_BRIDGE` (decision 14). |

## 8. Known limits (measured or read, not guessed)

- Marlin `G4` calls `planner.synchronize()` (`Marlin/src/gcode/motion/G4.cpp:36` on `il/lumen-rev05`), so the per-dot
  dwell drains the motion queue once per dot (the bench recipe wants that dwell).
- Marlin accelerates a B-only move at the current `M204 S` (`M201 B` is only a cap), hence the `M204 S20000` around
  the B moves; the validator keeps X/Y/Z out from under it.
- `M201`/`M203` for B persist in Marlin RAM until reset (not saved without `M500`).
- `M990` semantics are the shared contract; the firmware side is on `il/safety`, which is not flashed. Pings are sent
  between lines, so a single command that blocks longer than the watchdog window delays the next ping.
- OpenPnP's simulated controller (GcodeServer) does not report `Count` in `M114` (the engine takes 0, with a warning)
  and times B with machine.xml's B axis limits (100 °/s, 500 °/s²); the sim acceptance raises them in its copy.
- In the simulator the top camera is a static image: the clean-pad guard and dot vision cannot pass there.
- `honorBacklash` with this machine's X/Y `OneSidedPositioning` makes every XY move end with OpenPnP's backlash
  approach (a second, half-speed 0.1 mm move): about 10 ms per dot that `tools/disp.py` does not spend
  (`src/test/sim/il_sim_acceptance.py` DPH what-ifs: 1.5 s per 160-dot board).
- *Autoreg*, measured on the machine (2026-10-28/29): a home takes 21–23 s; fiducials re-found within 0.003–0.04 mm on
  the same seat; OpenPnP's homes repeat Z to 0.025 mm; the bench's Z frame is about 0.8 mm off OpenPnP's, so
  bench-measured Z numbers and the typed needle anchor are not valid in OpenPnP's frame. The rest of
  `AUTO_REGISTER_DESIGN.md` §11 (STOP during G28, VAC1 sensor mode, open-air readings, …) and the open review-1
  limits are in `REAL_MACHINE_TODO.md`.
- *Autoreg:* each probe point ends with the bench's lift, then the vent; a loose surface comes up with N1
  (`REAL_MACHINE_TODO.md` F7). The engine learns the home duration per OpenPnP session only.
- *Profile:* **the paste model's limits** (PC §1, the confidence each number carries). Fitted on steady-state dots
  only: the mass per step at 18 psi (2.11 mg per turn, `tools/lumen.py`) and the 0603 half turn the user validated
  after reflow (1.06 mg on 0.73 mm², the per-family anchor) are measured; the footprint law's quarter- and one-turn
  ends (d 0.83–1.00 mm at a quarter turn), the ripple factors, the 0.72 mm tip OD behind the same-pad pitch, the
  `k = 0.5` above 4 mm², the fine-pitch cap (0.25 mm print) and the 8 h freshness are assumptions until the machine
  measures them (`REAL_MACHINE_TODO.md` items 38–52). The pad calibration measures mass, dot size, threads, repeat,
  phase and landing on the machine itself, so a type is `characterized` on measured numbers, never on the model's;
  `validated` needs a reflowed board (the test-board ladder, PC §9 / §20 decision 8, is a follow-up, not in this PR).
  An amount no allowed dose reaches within −25 %/+10 % (the Nano's LED_0805: one turn +33 %, half a turn −33 % on the
  machine) stays `provisional` whatever is measured.
- *Profile:* the SIM paste (`sim.SimPaste`, `il_sim_scene.py --paste`) differs from the model on purpose (2.30 mg per
  turn, its own footprint law, ripple, noise, threads, bead carry-over, feed limit); it models the needle Z only as
  the gap to the surface, and its records are `simulated` (never evidence on the machine).
- No HTTP endpoints here; this is the Java service the web layer calls (`docs/instancelabs/WEB_API.md`; the bench
  recipe added `POST /api/plan/{id}/clean-check`, `POST /api/screw/start-angle`, `POST /api/purge-row/reset`).
