/**
 * The automatic N1 vacuum contact probe of one or more points: the bench method (tools/probe.py) with
 * two corrections measured in the bench log. At each spot N1 goes to travel Z, over the spot, down to
 * the approach height; pump and valve on, settle, an open-air baseline (5 reads); coarse 0.25 mm steps
 * until the 3-read mean falls below baseline - max(40000, 15 % of |baseline|). Then, unlike the bench:
 * back to the last open coarse step until the seal lets go (the bench's fine pass started right after
 * the seal and reported contact up to 0.3 mm high, 29 of 156 passes at their first step; one step
 * higher when that step itself holds a partial seal), and a fine pass of 0.025 mm steps below it whose
 * contact needs two sealed steps in a row (partial seals reach the threshold's size). A fine miss re-probes once from the start; the coarse contact is never
 * accepted. Every point ends with the bench's lift and vent: {@code G1 Z<travel> F600, M400, M107 P1,
 * M107 P0}, also after a refusal or an error inside it; only a STOP sends nothing but the I1 shutdown.
 *
 * <p>Every line goes through {@link Io} (the executor's probe gate: the probe allowlist and the abort
 * flag). Contact Z is the N1 Z of the contact step: N1's OpenPnP Z is its raw Z (z1). X/Y move only at
 * travel Z, Z never below the window's floor nor above the travel Z, and the only output lines are
 * N1's pump and valve on and off.</p>
